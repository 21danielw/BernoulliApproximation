# BernoulliApproximation
The BernoulliApproximation contains Julia code that uses Bernoulli matrix polynomials to approximate matrix exponentials. The algorithm is described in my paper "Implementing an algorithm using Bernoulli matrix polynomials to approximate matrix exponentials."
To run the Julia code:
1. Fork this repository.
2. Include the module BernoulliApproximation.jl in your code.
3. Call the function bernoulli(A, mk, s) in your code.
